# Functions - Not Netlify

All folders in the root of this directory hold individual [AWS Lambda Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html).

Lambda functions in this directory should be maintained and deployed independently.

***NOTE: FUNCTIONS IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE NOT MAINTAINED BY NETLIFY NOR ARE THEY AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYED. FOLLOW INDIVIDUAL BUILD AND DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS PER FUNCTION.***
